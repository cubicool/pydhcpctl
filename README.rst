pydhcpctl
=========

A CPython extension module for querying DHCP leases on a network using the ISC
DHCP server. It builds easily on Linux, and has been tested with Feodra, Ubuntu,
Debian, and RedHat with no issues. You will need to make sure you have your
distro's appropriate dhcp-server development headers/package.

Example
=======

Github doesn't allow the "include" RST directive (for sensible security reasons),
so you will have to click on this link to `see an example`_ of using phdhcpctl.
